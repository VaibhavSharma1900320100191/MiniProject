			<h4>The Beauty of A Sunset</h4>
			<div class="img-container"> <img src="../images/blogpic1.jpg"></div>
			<p>
				Why is it that when our eyes fix onto the warm colors of the setting sun we’re transported to an enchanted world? Most people can agree that a good sunset holds the power to stop just about anyone in their tracks — studies have even shown that instances of awe in watching sunsets cause psychological effects that enhance long-lasting satisfaction in life. If that’s not reason enough to stop and appreciate the setting sun, I don’t know what is.</br>

				For all you hopeless romantics out there like myself, the real  reason why we glorify these instances of beauty is because they are simply that… idealized romance. Sundown seems to embody the sheer power of an utterly romantic point in time. Just like love at first sight, it takes your breath away, leaves you speechless and if only for a moment, slows down time. In that instant, you feel the love and gratitude for Mother Nature exude from every inch of your body. A sunset possesses the promise of a new day. With the sun’s last rays peeking out from the horizon comes the realization that tomorrow holds endless possibilities. You know it won’t last, but you savor every last bit of that fleeting beauty.</br>

				Recently I’ve come to realize that I collect sunsets. Whether it’s walking to my car at the end of the workday or strolling the sands of an exotic beach, without even noticing it, I’ve managed to use a camera lens to take these evenings home with me. This collection of  cotton candy clouds and radiating hues represents some of the most beautiful moments and most wonderful memories in my life. These snapshots have become sacred treasures in my heart.
