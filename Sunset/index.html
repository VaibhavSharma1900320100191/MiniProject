			<h2>Are you a Sunset person or Sunrise person? </h2>
			<p> Trying to compare subjective beauty is always fraught – more so when said beauty is merely an accidental pleasure arising from the Earth’s slow march around its own axis. But, if we can’t take a moment from our busy lives to ponder the world’s loveliness, and phenomenons that fill our mind with peace and joy, then you are not living your life; you are just surving the onslaught of challenges that life puts in your way.

			<p>Sunrises and sunsets are the universe’s present to the Earth’s flawed populace. They are at once humbling and life affirming, blessed in their simplicity and impossible in their majesty. And as travellers, we’re lucky enough to witness these wonderful events in varying incarnations. Does a sunrise in Cambodia match a sunset in Peru? What about a sunrise on a New York City street compared to a sunset at India’s Taj Mahal? The world is awash with different backdrops for these golden occasions.</p>

			</div>
			<p>But while we can all hold hands and frolic in fields and kumbaya and agree that sun-filled moments, and the golden hours that precede and succeed them, are universally wonderful – let’s remember for a second that if one was to pit these two times of day against each other, suddenly the hand-holding commune would break and kumbaya would morph into some kind of alternative death metal.

			For if there is one thing we humans love more than unparalleled beauty and smug holiday sunset photos, it is trivial arguments.

			So, I’m doing just that. I’m pitting sunrises and sunsets against each other. I’m sorry. Here’s what I think:</p>

			<h3> On Sunsets</h3>
			<p>
				But, you know what else sunsets are? Predictable. There’s no challenge in a sunset. Walk out of your office and bask in its immediate glory. Cook dinner as last light drips off you through an innocuous window. Go find a hill, a rooftop, a beach, and become immersed in its fiery splendour. There’s no barrier to entry. Sunsets are almost always spectacular. Hot orange and pink and yellow, velvet and rich and lovely. The typical blonde girl-next-door of sun events. You know what? Give us gappy teeth and crooked noses and eyes too big any day, man.</br>

				Sunsets have sold out. They are Jim Morrison singing reprieves of ‘come on Quick light my fire’ (ok ok ok he vetoed this before it was aired, but can you imagine?!). They are the fodder of pseudo spiritual yoga bloggers and Instagram addicts, add a dolphin and you have yourself a classic hippy wall hanging. Sunsets are ordinary, they are passé, they are irrefutably common.

				</br>So I am team sunrise.
